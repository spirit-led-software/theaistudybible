Dear [Translation Copyright Holder],

I am writing to request permission to include your Bible translation in The AI Study Bible (theaistudybible.com), an innovative platform that combines artificial intelligence with biblical scholarship to create an unprecedented Bible study experience.

Our platform uniquely positions your translation to reach a new generation of Bible readers by:
1. Enhanced Understanding: We leverage advanced AI technology to provide real-time, contextual insights that help readers better understand the historical, cultural, and theological context of scripture passages.
2. Interactive Study Experience: Rather than replacing traditional commentary, we augment scripture study with AI-powered tools that allow readers to ask questions, explore cross-references, and discover deeper connections within the text.
3. Responsible AI Integration: Our platform maintains the integrity of biblical text while using AI as a study companion. Your translation would be clearly attributed and displayed separately from AI-generated content, preserving its authority and authenticity.
4. Digital Accessibility: We've built a modern, accessible platform that makes scripture study more approachable for digital natives while maintaining reverence for the text.
5. Educational Impact: The platform serves as both a personal study tool and a resource for Bible study groups, seminaries, and churches, amplifying the reach and impact of your translation.
6. Preservation of Rights: We fully respect copyright protection and will implement any usage restrictions or attribution requirements you specify. Your translation would be integrated under a clear licensing agreement that protects your intellectual property.

By including your translation in The AI Study Bible, you'll help bridge the gap between traditional biblical scholarship and modern technology, making scripture more accessible and comprehensible to today's readers while maintaining its sacred nature.

We would welcome the opportunity to discuss this partnership further and demonstrate how our platform can serve as a valuable channel for sharing your translation with a broader audience.

Thank you for considering this opportunity. We look forward to the possibility of working together to make your translation more widely accessible and impactful.

Sincerely,

#### Ian Pascoe
