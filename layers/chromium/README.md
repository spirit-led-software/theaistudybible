Download the chromium layer from GitHub, then run the SST stack:

```
# from this directory:
wget https://github.com/Sparticuz/chromium/releases/download/v114.0.0/chromium-v114.0.0-layer.zip
unzip chromium-v114.0.0-layer.zip
rm -rf chromium-v114.0.0-layer.zip
```

Make sure that the version of chromium aligns with the required version from puppeteer: https://pptr.dev/chromium-support
