# Naming Conventions
- Components: PascalCase
- Functions: camelCase with auxiliary verbs (isLoading, hasError)
- Directories: kebab-case (auth-wizard, user-settings)
- Types: PascalCase with descriptive names
- Constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
- Favor named exports over default exports

# Security Best Practices
- Implement proper input sanitization
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- Validate user permissions at every level
- Sanitize AI outputs before rendering
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Use Content Security Policy headers

# AI Integration Patterns
- Implement proper token counting and management
- Structure system prompts for consistent outputs
- Handle streaming responses efficiently
- Implement proper error handling for AI calls
- Cache AI responses when appropriate
- Use vector embeddings for semantic search
- Implement retry logic for API failures

# Testing Strategy
- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Implement integration tests for API endpoints
- Use component testing for UI elements
- Implement E2E tests for critical paths
- Mock external services in tests
- Use proper test isolation
- Implement proper error boundary testing

# Documentation
- Document complex business logic
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Document environment setup requirements
- Keep README files up to date
- Document deployment procedures
- Add inline comments for complex algorithms
- Document AI prompt templates
